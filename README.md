# React-Native-App
It is a basic music app where I have added the UI like some music apps have.
It has categories, banners with carousels and list of songs with thumbnail as images of the song movies.
Once you click on the song you go to the player where you can play pause the song. Skip, forward and backward functionality is not added yet.
In the player swiping right will take you back to the feed from where you played the song and the song pauses.
Also on each song download button and three dots icon is there. Not added download functionality but on clicking three dots a modal will open from where you can play the song and add it to playlist.
As github restricts file size not more than 25 mb I have not added the sounds in assets folder here but the apk of the app plays well.
